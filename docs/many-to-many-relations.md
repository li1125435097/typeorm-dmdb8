## What are many-to-many relations

Many-to-many is a relation where A contains multiple instances of B, and B contain multiple instances of A.
Let's take for example `Question` and `Category` entities.
A question can have multiple categories, and each category can have multiple questions.

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from "typeorm";

@Entity()
export class Category {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;
}
```

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToMany, JoinTable } from "typeorm";
import { Category } from "./Category";

@Entity()
export class Question {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    title: string;

    @Column()
    text: string;

    @ManyToMany(() => Category)
    @JoinTable()
    categories: Category[];
}
```

`@JoinTable()` is required for `@ManyToMany` relations.
You must put `@JoinTable` on one (owning) side of relation.

This example will produce following tables:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                        category                         |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+

+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                        question                         |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| title       | varchar(255) |                            |
| text        | varchar(255) |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+

+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|              question_categories_category               |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| questionId  | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
| categoryId  | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

## Saving many-to-many relations

With [cascades](./relations.md#cascades) enabled, you can save this relation with only one `save` call.

```typescript
const category1 = new Category();
category1.name = "animals";
await connection.manager.save(category1);

const category2 = new Category();
category2.name = "zoo";
await connection.manager.save(category2);

const question = new Question();
question.title = "dogs";
question.text = "who let the dogs out?";
question.categories = [category1, category2];
await connection.manager.save(question);
```

## Deleting many-to-many relations

With [cascades](./relations.md#cascades) enabled, you can delete this relation with only one `save` call.

To delete a many-to-many relationship between two records, remove it from the corresponding field and save the record.

```typescript
const question = getRepository(Question);
question.categories = question.categories.filter(category => {
    return category.id !== categoryToRemove.id
})
await connection.manager.save(question)
```

This will only remove the record in the join table. The `question` and `categoryToRemove` records will still exist.

## Soft Deleting a relationship with cascade

This example shows how the cascading soft delete behaves:

```typescript
const category1 = new Category();
category1.name = "animals";

const category2 = new Category();
category2.name = "zoo";

const question = new Question();
question.categories = [category1, category2];
const newQuestion = await connection.manager.save(question);

await connection.manager.softRemove(newQuestion);
```

In this example we did not call save or softRemove for category1 and category2, but they will be automatically saved and soft-deleted when the cascade of relation options is set to true like this:

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToMany, JoinTable } from "typeorm";
import { Category } from "./Category";

@Entity()
export class Question {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @ManyToMany(() => Category, category => category.questions, {
        cascade: true
    })
    @JoinTable()
    categories: Category[];
}
```

## Loading many-to-many relations

To load questions with categories inside you must specify the relation in `FindOptions`:

```typescript
const questionRepository = connection.getRepository(Question);
const questions = await questionRepository.find({ relations: ["categories"] });
```

Or using `QueryBuilder` you can join them:

```typescript
const questions = await connection
    .getRepository(Question)
    .createQueryBuilder("question")
    .leftJoinAndSelect("question.categories", "category")
    .getMany();
```

With eager loading enabled on a relation, you don't have to specify relations in the find command as it will ALWAYS be loaded automatically. If you use QueryBuilder eager relations are disabled, you have to use `leftJoinAndSelect` to load the relation.

## Bi-directional relations

Relations can be uni-directional and bi-directional.
Uni-directional relations are relations with a relation decorator only on one side.
Bi-directional relations are relations with decorators on both sides of a relation.

We just created a uni-directional relation. Let's make it bi-directional:

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToMany } from "typeorm";
import { Question } from "./Question";

@Entity()
export class Category {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    name: string;

    @ManyToMany(() => Question, question => question.categories)
    questions: Question[];
}
```

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, ManyToMany, JoinTable } from "typeorm";
import { Category } from "./Category";

@Entity()
export class Question {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column()
    title: string;

    @Column()
    text: string;

    @ManyToMany(() => Category, category => category.questions)
    @JoinTable()
    categories: Category[];
}
```

We just made our relation bi-directional. Note that the inverse relation does not have a `@JoinTable`.
`@JoinTable` must be only on one side of the relation.

Bi-directional relations allow you to join relations from both sides using `QueryBuilder`:

```typescript
const categoriesWithQuestions = await connection
    .getRepository(Category)
    .createQueryBuilder("category")
    .leftJoinAndSelect("category.questions", "question")
    .getMany();
```

## Many-to-many relations with custom properties

In case you need to have additional properties in your many-to-many relationship, you have to create a new entity yourself.
For example, if you would like entities `Post` and `Category` to have a many-to-many relationship with an additional `order` column, then you need to create an entity `PostToCategory` with two `ManyToOne` relations pointing in both directions and with custom columns in it:

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, ManyToOne, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm";
import { Post } from "./post";
import { Category } from "./category";

@Entity()
export class PostToCategory {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    public postToCategoryId!: number;

    @Column()
    public postId!: number;

    @Column()
    public categoryId!: number;

    @Column()
    public order!: number;

    @ManyToOne(() => Post, post => post.postToCategories)
    public post!: Post;

    @ManyToOne(() => Category, category => category.postToCategories)
    public category!: Category;
}
```

Additionally you will have to add a relationship like the following to `Post` and `Category`:

```typescript
// category.ts
...
@OneToMany(() => PostToCategory, postToCategory => postToCategory.category)
public postToCategories!: PostToCategory[];

// post.ts
...
@OneToMany(() => PostToCategory, postToCategory => postToCategory.post)
public postToCategories!: PostToCategory[];
```
